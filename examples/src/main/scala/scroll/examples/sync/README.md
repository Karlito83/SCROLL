SCROLL - Synchronization example
======

## Introduction ##

The presented example described the synchronization of 3 related models. Therefore the Family-to-Person example from the Transformation Tool Contest 2017 (TTC 2017) is used.

## Example ##

Install SCROLL as developers installation and than run the ExampleSync.scala document. The developer installation is needed because the example uses functionality that is not in the actual release of SCROLL.
